# Hotel-Plaza
Mandatory Assignment

The purpose of this exercise is to design and develop a program that handles bookings, rooms and guests at a hotel. It allows the receptionist to view, add, edit, and delete rooms, guest data and bookings, while it also allows the Accountant to make changes in Staff data. It is built on JGrasp, as part of the study curiculum of the Computer Science education at Copenhagen School of Technology and Design in November 2019. Try it out!
